      <strong>foreward:</strong><br>
Most people even use the terms <strong>“Machine Learning”</strong>, <strong>“Deep Learning”</strong> and <strong>“Artificial Intelligence”</strong> interchangeably,
however, each of these interlinked terminologies are unique and useful in its own way.<br><br>

<strong>Artificial intelligence</strong> is the leveraging of computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making abilities of a human mind. 🧠 <br><br>

<strong>Machine Learning</strong> uses interconnected nodes (like neurons) in a layered structure that resembles the human brain. It creates an adaptive system that computers use to learn from their mistakes and improve continuously.The structure/model used to do this is a Neural Network.
It mimics the human brain through a set of algorithms.<br><br>

In its simplest form, a <strong>Neural Network</strong> only has three layers:<br>
1.	The input layer<br>
2.	Hidden layer<br>
3.	The output layer<br><br>

A <strong>neural network</strong> with multiple hidden layers with multiple nodes is known as a <strong>deep learning system</strong>, or a <strong>deep neural network</strong> (which helps predicts an output from complex data).so to recap: A <strong>Neural Network</strong> is the structure of <strong>Machine Learning</strong> for ><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>
