      <br> Unit 9: I&S: Food
      <br>
      <br> <strong> Themes:</strong>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;•	The Impact of The Cost Of Living Crises on Independent Stores
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;•	The Relationship between:
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<The Store <> The Consumer <> The Community
        <br>
        <br>I aim to be investigating the the commerce of food in London and how has it changed in relation to the cost-of-living crisis.
        <br>
        <br>Looking at:
        <br>•	Supply Chains
        <br>•	Government Polices on Tax
        <br>•	Economics
        
        <br>
        <br>
      <br> It’s a multi-faceted topic that touches and is related lots of diferrent sectors in our world, so I had to intersectionally contextualise my data in research, looking at:
      <br>
      <br>
        <br>•	The Cost-of-Living Crisis
        <br>•	The Climate Crisis
        <br>•	The Power of Media’s Coverage
        <br>•	Social Inequality
        <br>•	Capitalism
        <br>•	Neoliberalism

      <br><p>
      <br><strong>The Research Database (Public for use):</strong>
      <br>Here I have a Miro board where I keep all my research, I’ve been building on the Cost-of-Living Crisis over the summer. It’s a large pool of 
      <br>Themes < Contextualisation < Data < Infrastructure (systems that have been designed into our world)
      <br>
      <br>I’ve organised the map into rings. To the right side this unit 9 project lies – introducing new ideas and connecting them with the rest of the map.
